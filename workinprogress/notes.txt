        start = SpatialObjectKey.keyLowerBound(z(SpaceImpl.Z_MIN));
        cursor = index.cursor(start.z());
        record = cursor.previous();

MergeCursor:

- <init>, forward = true

- start, first input is empty ForestMapRangeCursor, second is PrivateMap.

After construction of cursor, goto lowerBound((0, 57)), closing cursor

- MergeCursor.close(), closing both inputs

- MergeCursor.<init>, forward = true, #1219

- start

previous:

- MergeCursor.previous. state = NEVER_USED, startKey = null

- restartAtStartKey(false): goToLast() *** START KEY WASN'T SAVED

returns first (?!) record, should have returned null

doesn't return last: state is NEVER_USED, so current root.record is
used, (no promotion). Record is leftover from when we were going
forward. No, actually, it's because forward wasn't set to false.


*** restartAtKey should set this.forward = forward even if startKey =
    null.
